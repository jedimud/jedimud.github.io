**Brief Description**
```
A Jelsontronix superstabber, Model 101 is lying here.
```

**Full Description**
```
The superstabber is the latest and greatest achievement in offensive,
backstabbing weaponry, by Jelsontronix INC.  The contoured black leather
grip sheathes a powerful but retractable blade.  When the user pushes
the small hidden catch in the grip, 9 inches of CO2-powered Damascus
steel will plunge into the victim at 500 psi.  This fine instrument
is guaranteed to pierce the toughest hides.

An inscription is on the grip:

"Jelsontronix -- making life better for the contemporary adventurer."

R. Mussen                                       In loving memory
CEO/Chief Engineer                                   R.S.K.
Jelsontronix, Ltd.

Underneath the first inscription, another is written in ultra-fine print:
WARNING: Carrying this weapon is illegal in most provinces.  Check
with your local authorities for more information.  We are not
responsible for any deaths due to this weapon's use or misuse.
